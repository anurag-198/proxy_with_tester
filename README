How to test the proxy

First build the files with make 
1. make
2. we will get a binary file name proxy.
3. run it as ./proxy <port no>
4. in other terminal test the proxy as

telnet localhost <port no>

which gives output as
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.

Type this (connect to any address on network without proxy)

GET http://www.iiita.ac.in/ HTTP/1.0

gives

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
